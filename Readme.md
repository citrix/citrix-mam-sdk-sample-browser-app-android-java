## Description

This repository contains the Android Java source code for a sample browser app that uses the MAM SDKs for endpoint management.  It does not contain the [MAM SDK](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/mdx-toolkit/mam-sdk-overview.html) libraries themselves, which are downloaded separately.

## Download

The MAM SDK libraries can be downloaded from [MAM SDKs and Toolkit](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/mdx-toolkit/mam-sdk-overview.html).

## Documentation

For detailed documentation on how to use this sample app, and compile it, see the [MAM SDK for Android Native Overview](https://developer.cloud.com/citrixworkspace/mobile-application-integration/android-native/docs/overview).  Documentation is also included in the MAM SDK download package.
